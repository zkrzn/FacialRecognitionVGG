# Facial Recognition using VGG-16 and VGG-19 Deep Learning Models

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a facial recognition system based on the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) deep learning models, VGG-16 and VGG-19. Facial recognition is a crucial technology in many fields, including security, surveillance, and authentication.

## Approach

Our approach utilizes the powerful VGG model to extract significant facial features from images. These features are then used to train a classification algorithm that enables the identification of individuals. The system we have implemented is distinguished by its remarkable accuracy and resistance to variations in lighting, facial expressions, and position.

## Implementation

The project is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The code is structured as follows:

1. **Data Loading:** The celebrity dataset is loaded and divided into training and testing sets.
2. **Data Preparation:** Images are resized and preprocessed for model training.
3. **VGG19 Model Creation:** The pre-trained VGG19 model is loaded, and the top layers are modified to adapt to the number of classes in the dataset.
4. **VGG19 Model Training:** The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set.
5. **VGG19 Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using the confusion matrix and learning curves.
6. **VGG16 Model Creation:** The pre-trained VGG16 model is loaded, and the top layers are modified to adapt to the number of classes in the dataset.
7. **VGG16 Model Training:** The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set.
8. **VGG16 Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using the confusion matrix and learning curves.
9. **Model Comparison:** The performances of the VGG19 and VGG16 models are compared to determine the best-performing model.
10. **Web Application:** A user-friendly web application is developed to allow users to upload an image and obtain the corresponding class prediction using the VGG19 and VGG16 models.

## Results

The results show that the VGG19 and VGG16 models achieve high accuracy in facial recognition. The VGG19 model slightly outperformed the VGG16 model in terms of accuracy.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the power of VGG deep learning models for facial recognition. The developed system is accurate, robust, and user-friendly.

## Usage

To use the facial recognition system, you can upload an image and send it to the web application. The application will predict the class of the image using the VGG19 or VGG16 model.

## Future Work

Future work could include:

* Improving model accuracy by using data augmentation and regularization techniques.
* Exploring new deep learning models for facial recognition.
* Developing a mobile application for facial recognition.
